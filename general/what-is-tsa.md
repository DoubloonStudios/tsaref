## Structure

### Membership

There are 3 "levels" of organization in TSA: chapter, state, and national.

Chapters are basically just clubs at the school level. Often, leadership is less formal from how meetings are conducted to how officers are selected.

There are 3 types of TSA chapters: Red CAP, White CAP, and Blue CAP.

Red CAP chapters have 10 or less members. When over 10 members are added, it becomes a White CAP chapter and must pay additional fees. Blue CAP chapters can add as many members as they want without additional cost.

### Officers

Officers are elected active TSA members that will manage delegations with the help of an advisor at the chapter level or an executive director for the state or national levels.

- President: presides at all meetings.
- Vice-President: accepts the responsibility of the president as needed.
- Secretary: records proceedings of all meetings.
- Treasurer: manages membership records and finances, often helping with fundraising and ordering materials.
- Sergeant-at-Arms: prepares and runs meetings according to parliamentary procedure (for formal state and national meetings).
- Reporter: accumulates information, prepares articles for publishing on TSA, and networks with other chapters.

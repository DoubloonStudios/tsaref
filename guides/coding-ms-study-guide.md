## Overview

This guide was created for the [Coding MS challenge](https://j-nac.github.io/TSA-Reference/middleschool/coding-ms.html).
Answer the questions for practice.
Don’t worry too much about this. You just need a general idea of all these things. Around 70% knowledge and you should pass easily.

## Computer Hardware

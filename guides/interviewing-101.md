## Overview

Almost every competitor in TSA will eventually have to prepare for and learn to be interviewed. Having a good interview is all about (1) showing the judges you know what you're talking about and (2) you have a vision for your project.

## How to get Good at Being Interviewed

Getting good at interviews requires practice. Get someone like an advisor or mentor to ask questions to prepare. Make sure each person in the interview has a role for what they'll discuss; this helps avoid having people speak over each other.

## Basic Questions

## Additional Tips

- You are expected to wear proper TSA attire for the interview
- Make eye contact
- Don't say "uhh"
- Remember to pause before answering to make sure you have a response instead of stumbling through (this will help you avoid saying "uhh")
- Too many people can make the interview less cohesive. About 2 members to attend is a good number

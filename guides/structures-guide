Structures General Info:
You're tasked with building a certain structure dependent on the theme of that year.
This structure will have certain specifications that you need to follow; which if not met could result in a 20% deduction of your overall score.
Most often, scores are base on the efficiency of your structure; how much weight it can hold compared to how heavy it is.
For your project you're required to build one strucutre pre-event which will be submitted and judged. You will then be required to build another one on site within a specified time limit.
You're also required to submit an early submission, that essentially acts as a progress check. You are not scored based on it, however, if you fail to submit something you will most likely be disqualified.
Your overall score is based on your on-site and pre-event structure.

General Tips For Truss Bridges:
T shaped lamination is allowed and are extremely effective; use it on core of your bridge, areas such as the middle which is required to hold a large portion of the weight.
The best way for you to succeed is to build multiple bridges throughout the year to improve your design and skill.

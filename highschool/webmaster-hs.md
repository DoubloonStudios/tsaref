- The website is judged on appearance, content, and function.
- There must be an about page on the website where all the documentation goes.
- The website, in addition to basic HTML, may use other technologies like Java applets and HTML5.

## Competing

### Organization

As with most large projects, it's best to have a system to keep everything organized.

Google Drive is a good way to keep all documentation, brainstorming ideas, and meeting notes together. Make one shared folder for the team then add the following subfolders for organization:

- Meetings. Meeting agendas and notes.
- Documentation. Store all the documentation.
- Brainstorming. All your ideas for the website compiled into one.
- Assets. Store things like photos as a backup.

You will also need a way to contact the people in your team efficiently. Texting, [Discord](https://discord.com/), or [Slack](https://slack.com/) all work. You may also want to do online meetings every couple weeks to check in on Discord or [Zoom](https://zoom.us/).

[Github](https://github.com/) is easily the best option for collaborating on the code for 70% of projects. [Repl.it](https://replit.com) is another option which allows you to collaborate live and it can host static websites, Flask, and Node.js.

### Selecting a stack & frameworks

One of the easiest ways to create your website is to simply make a static site with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You can create a repository on [Github](https://github.com/) for it and then host it by enabling Github pages in the settings.

More experienced developers might want to do fancier things like store information in database or have a dynamic site. For that, you'll need to decide on a web stack.

A web stack is a collection of software used to create a website. They all typically consist of some web server, database server, and programming language. [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29) (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP or Python) and [MEAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)) (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js) are two common options. While not really a stack on it's own, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) is a web framework that uses Python which is easy to learn. Go with whatever your team knows best. If you still can't decide, go with the MEAN stack.

For hosting your website, as mentioned before, if it's a static website, you can simply use [Github](https://github.com/). [Repl.it](https://replit.com) is an option for Node.js and Flask. For more complex applications, a service like [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) might work best. You can configure also Heroku to automatically update when your Github repository is updated.

Frameworks and libraries for CSS and Javascript will help save time and headache.

Common CSS frameworks:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Most common.
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). Another good option.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/). Growing in popularity but uses unorthodox approach.

Common Javascript libraries:

- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Makes DOM of a pain.
- [animae.js](https://animejs.com/). Animate stuff.

### Designing the website

Record your ideas an text on a Google document in the shared folder mentioned before. You can create a rough outline of the website on paper to share. [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) is a tool you can you to make rough designs as well.

Creating the website will require careful thought in the UI, color scheme, and text to make navigation easy for the user and to make it visually appealing. [Flux](https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxWithRanSegall) is a Youtube channel with tutorials and information on web design. You can create a color pallette with [coolors](https://coolors.co/) and select fonts and icons with [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

### Documentation

In the about page you must put all the documentation for your website. It must include a list of the sources of information you used, documentation for all copyrighted material, the Student Copyright Checklist as a PDF, and the Plan of Work log as a PDF.

### Creating a Solution

Creating a good solution boils down to following the design process and iterating.

Begin by identifying, defining, and exploring the problem. This may include going out and asking people about about a problem they're facing or observing people. Then, brainstorm and create a prototype. Get feedback on it, make needed improvements, and repeat the process up until the demonstration.

### Demonstration

The demonstration can be organized with the following points:

- Explaining the problem
- What your solution is
- Live demonstration of the solution
- Explaining your process for creating the solution

Practice your demonstration multiple times beforehand with people to get feedback and to ensure it runs smoothly.

## Competing

### Form a team

While teams may have up to 6 members, it is not necesssarily advantageous to have a large team as it takes exponentially more organization as scale increases. Also take into consideration how members will contribute to a team. Typically, this means dividing people between artists and programmers. There are no "idea people" who contribute nothing but say what they want the game to look like. Everyone has good ideas.

### Read the rules

Every year, event rules are updated. Your advisor should have access to the new rules via the the [TSA membership site](https://tsamembership.registermychapter.com). Rules surrounding the game itself are fairly straightforward: no inappropriate content and upload the game as a web URL playable in browser. The portfolio is where you need to pay absolute attention. Judges want detailed documentation in the Plan of Work Log, a dense Purpose and Description, and lots of storyboards.

As soon as your team is assembled, you should create the work log and fill it out for any contribution to the game - code, art, music, docmentation work, meetings, etc. Make sure to add comments for every entry.

### Organize documentation and assets



### Brainstorm and storyboard



### Create the MVP

MVP stands for "minimum viable product." As the name implies, the MVP is bones of the game - the base mechanics. This video by Extra Credits succinctly explains MVPs in detail and why they're critical, but in short, they're important for testing whether your game idea has value before you invest too much in it.

### Playtest

Get people to try it out and see if your game is any good. If it isn't, go back to the drawing board. If it is, note what needs to be fixed or improved.

### Revise

Adjust according to the feedback. Add features and flesh out your game. Then, send it back to playtesting to repeat the process.

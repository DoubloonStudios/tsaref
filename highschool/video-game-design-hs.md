## Competing

### Form a team

While teams may have up to 6 members, it is not necesssarily advantageous to have a large team as it takes exponentially more organization as scale increases. Also take into consideration how members will contribute to a team. Typically, this means dividing people between artists and programmers. There are no "idea people" who contribute nothing but say what they want the game to look like. Everyone has good ideas.

### Read the rules
### Organize documentation and assets
### Brainstorm ideas & select a game engine
### Draft storyboards
